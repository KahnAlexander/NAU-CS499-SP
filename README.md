# NAU-CS499-SP

So looks like we are hitting our request limit, but for some reason it's intermittent, like for a school, a patch of 20 requests will be not found, due to request limit break, then will start receiving again after that patch.

Some school's addresses are wrong, or don't exist. Looks like NAU has no found address for whatever reason, looks like ERAU has wrong address. Need to verify these somehow.
